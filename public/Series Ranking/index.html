<h1>The best 3 Series in the World According to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Series of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<h4>10/10</h4>
<p>
  Game of Thrones is truly the best of all. It's unlike most shows or movies
  that revolve around a single protagonist or narrow storyline.<br />
  This season stands out because it masterfully intertwines a world of
  characters, families, and gripping narratives in a way Iâ€™ve never experienced
  before.

<h3>Arcane</h3>
<h4>9.8/10</h4>
<p>
  As a person who does'n't play LoL, I used to watch my brothers play the game
  all the time purely because I was so fascinated by the lore.<br / > I was not
  a fan of the game but I am a fan of its universe. I would often think about
  how awesome it could be if they are to be adapted into an animated film or
  series.<br / > That's why I was so delighted when they announced Arcane out of
  the blue because finally, non-players like myself are able to enjoy the
  wonders Runeterra and the amazing collection of characters it has to offer.

<h3>Stranger things</h3>
<h4>9.5/10</h4>
<p>
  Very fun,refreshing show with a strong sci-fi backbone for us old X-file fans.
  ST seems to connect with a very wide audience and is no more just "teen"
  entertainment than 'It' was. I am perhaps one of the lucky viewers to have
  been near that age in 83'-85' & had discovered D&D as a teen.The show nails
  early 80's without forcing it into all scenes & often feels like a strangely
  HD old series you somehow missed....Cringed seeing those awful striped tube
  socks again at Starcourt so,yeah perhaps a little more horror in this for some
  of us who had blocked that stuff outðŸ¤­.
